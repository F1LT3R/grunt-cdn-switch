 * @name ngAnimate
 * @description
 *
 * The `ngAnimate` module provides support for JavaScript, CSS3 transition and CSS3 keyframe animation hooks within existing core and custom directives.
 *
 * <div doc-module-components="ngAnimate"></div>
 *
 * # Usage
 *
 * To see animations in action, all that is required is to define the appropriate CSS classes
 * or to register a JavaScript animation via the `myModule.animation()` function. The directives that support animation automatically are:
 * `ngRepeat`, `ngInclude`, `ngIf`, `ngSwitch`, `ngShow`, `ngHide`, `ngView` and `ngClass`. Custom directives can take advantage of animation
 * by using the `$animate` service.
 *
 * Below is a more detailed breakdown of the supported animation events provided by pre-existing ng directives:
 *
 * | Directive                                                                                                | Supported Animations                                                     |
 * |----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------|
 * | {@link ng.directive:ngRepeat#animations ngRepeat}                                                        | enter, leave and move                                                    |
 * | {@link ngRoute.directive:ngView#animations ngView}                                                       | enter and leave                                                          |
 * | {@link ng.directive:ngInclude#animations ngInclude}                                                      | enter and leave                                                          |
 * | {@link ng.directive:ngSwitch#animations ngSwitch}                                                        | enter and leave                                                          |
 * | {@link ng.directive:ngIf#animations ngIf}                                                                | enter and leave                                                          |
 * | {@link ng.directive:ngClass#animations ngClass}                                                          | add and remove (the CSS class(es) present)                               |
 * | {@link ng.directive:ngShow#animations ngShow} & {@link ng.directive:ngHide#animations ngHide}            | add and remove (the ng-hide class value)                                 |
 * | {@link ng.directive:form#animation-hooks form} & {@link ng.directive:ngModel#animation-hooks ngModel}    | add and remove (dirty, pristine, valid, invalid & all other validations) |
 * | {@link module:ngMessages#animations ngMessages}                                                          | add and remove (ng-active & ng-inactive)                                 |
 * | {@link module:ngMessages#animations ngMessage}                                                           | enter and leave                                                          |

 * You can find out more information about animations upon visiting each directive page.
 *
 * Below is an example of how to apply animations to a directive that supports animation hooks:
 *
 * ```html
 * <style type="text/css">
 * .slide.ng-enter, .slide.ng-leave {
 *   -webkit-transition:0.5s linear all;
 *   transition:0.5s linear all;
 * }
 *
 * .slide.ng-enter { }        /&#42; starting animations for enter &#42;/
 * .slide.ng-enter.ng-enter-active { } /&#42; terminal animations for enter &#42;/
 * .slide.ng-leave { }        /&#42; starting animations for leave &#42;/
 * .slide.ng-leave.ng-leave-active { } /&#42; terminal animations for leave &#42;/
 * </style>
 *
 * <!--
 * the animate service will automatically add .ng-enter and .ng-leave to the element
 * to trigger the CSS transition/animations
 * -->
 * <ANY class="slide" ng-include="..."></ANY>
 * ```
 *
 * Keep in mind that, by default, if an animation is running, any child elements cannot be animated
 * until the parent element's animation has completed. This blocking feature can be overridden by
 * placing the `ng-animate-children` attribute on a parent container tag.
 *
 * ```html
 * <div class="slide-animation" ng-if="on" ng-animate-children>
 *   <div class="fade-animation" ng-if="on">
 *     <div class="explode-animation" ng-if="on">
 *        ...
 *     </div>
 *   </div>
 * </div>
 * ```
 *
 * When the `on` expression value changes and an animation is triggered then each of the elements within
 * will all animate without the block being applied to child elements.
 *
 * ## Are animations run when the application starts?
 * No they are not. When an application is bootstrapped Angular will disable animations from running to avoid
 * a frenzy of animations from being triggered as soon as the browser has rendered the screen. For this to work,
 * Angular will wait for two digest cycles until enabling animations. From there on, any animation-triggering
 * layout changes in the application will trigger animations as normal.
 *
 * In addition, upon bootstrap, if the routing system or any directives or load remote data (via $http) then Angular
 * will automatically extend the wait time to enable animations once **all** of the outbound HTTP requests
 * are complete.
 *
 * ## CSS-defined Animations
 * The animate service will automatically apply two CSS classes to the animated element and these two CSS classes
 * are designed to contain the start and end CSS styling. Both CSS transitions and keyframe animations are supported
 * and can be used to play along with this naming structure.
 *
 * The following code below demonstrates how to perform animations using **CSS transitions** with Angular:
 *
 * ```html
 * <style type="text/css">
 * /&#42;
 *  The animate class is apart of the element and the ng-enter class
 *  is attached to the element once the enter animation event is triggered
 * &#42;/
 * .reveal-animation.ng-enter {
 *  -webkit-transition: 1s linear all; /&#42; Safari/Chrome &#42;/
 *  transition: 1s linear all; /&#42; All other modern browsers and IE10+ &#42;/
 *
 *  /&#42; The animation preparation code &#42;/
 *  opacity: 0;
 * }
 *
 * /&#42;
 *  Keep in mind that you want to combine both CSS
 *  classes together to avoid any CSS-specificity
 *  conflicts
 * &#42;/
 * .reveal-animation.ng-enter.ng-enter-active {
 *  /&#42; The animation code itself &#42;/
 *  opacity: 1;
 * }
 * </style>
 *
 * <div class="view-container">
 *   <div ng-view class="reveal-animation"></div>
 * </div>
 * ```
 *
 * The following code below demonstrates how to perform animations using **CSS animations** with Angular:
 *
 * ```html
 * <style type="text/css">
 * .reveal-animation.ng-enter {
 *   -webkit-animation: enter_sequence 1s linear; /&#42; Safari/Chrome &#42;/
 *   animation: enter_sequence 1s linear; /&#42; IE10+ and Future Browsers &#42;/
 * }
 * @-webkit-keyframes enter_sequence {
 *   from { opacity:0; }
 *   to { opacity:1; }
 * }
 * @keyframes enter_sequence {
 *   from { opacity:0; }
 *   to { opacity:1; }
 * }
 * </style>
 *
 * <div class="view-container">
 *   <div ng-view class="reveal-animation"></div>
 * </div>
 * ```
 *
 * Both CSS3 animations and transitions can be used together and the animate service will figure out the correct duration and delay timing.
 *
 * Upon DOM mutation, the event class is added first (something like `ng-enter`), then the browser prepares itself to add
 * the active class (in this case `ng-enter-active`) which then triggers the animation. The animation module will automatically
 * detect the CSS code to determine when the animation ends. Once the animation is over then both CSS classes will be
 * removed from the DOM. If a browser does not support CSS transitions or CSS animations then the animation will start and end
 * immediately resulting in a DOM element that is at its final state. This final state is when the DOM element
 * has no CSS transition/animation classes applied to it.
 *
 * ### Structural transition animations
 *
 * Structural transitions (such as enter, leave and move) will always apply a `0s none` transition
 * value to force the browser into rendering the styles defined in the setup (`.ng-enter`, `.ng-leave`
 * or `.ng-move`) class. This means that any active transition animations operating on the element
 * will be cut off to make way for the enter, leave or move animation.
 *
 * ### Class-based transition animations
 *
 * Class-based transitions refer to transition animations that are triggered when a CSS class is
 * added to or removed from the element (via `$animate.addClass`, `$animate.removeClass`,
 * `$animate.setClass`, or by directives such as `ngClass`, `ngModel` and `form`).
 * They are different when compared to structural animations since they **do not cancel existing
 * animations** nor do they **block successive transitions** from rendering on the same element.
 * This distinction allows for **multiple class-based transitions** to be performed on the same element.
 *
 * In addition to ngAnimate supporting the default (natural) functionality of class-based transition
 * animations, ngAnimate also decorates the element with starting and ending CSS classes to aid the
 * developer in further styling the element throughout the transition animation. Earlier versions
 * of ngAnimate may have caused natural CSS transitions to break and not render properly due to
 * $animate temporarily blocking transitions using `0s none` in order to allow the setup CSS class
 * (the `-add` or `-remove` class) to be applied without triggering an animation. However, as of
 * **version 1.3**, this workaround has been removed with ngAnimate and all non-ngAnimate CSS
 * class transitions are compatible with ngAnimate.
 *
 * There is, however, one special case when dealing with class-based transitions in ngAnimate.
 * When rendering class-based transitions that make use of the setup and active CSS classes
 * (e.g. `.fade-add` and `.fade-add-active` for when `.fade` is added) be sure to define
 * the transition value **on the active CSS class** and not the setup class.
 *
 * ```css
 * .fade-add {
 *   /&#42; remember to place a 0s transition here
 *      to ensure that the styles are applied instantly
 *      even if the element already has a transition style &#42;/
 *   transition:0s linear all;
 *
 *   /&#42; starting CSS styles &#42;/
 *   opacity:1;
 * }
 * .fade-add.fade-add-active {
 *   /&#42; this will be the length of the animation &#42;/
 *   transition:1s linear all;
 *   opacity:0;
 * }
 * ```
 *
 * The setup CSS class (in this case `.fade-add`) also has a transition style pr
